# skyexplain

*SkyExplain* GitHub organization â€” a small but growing hub for machine learning cosmological model classification with interpretable data analysis.  

We are developing open-source tools to simulate the cosmological datasets, apply neural networks to classify cosmological models and minimal extensions, and provide interpretable insights about the results.
